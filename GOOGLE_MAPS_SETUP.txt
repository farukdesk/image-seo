    GOOGLE MAPS API KEY SETUP
    
    To use the GEO location tagging feature, you need to configure your Google Maps API key.
    
    Follow these steps:
    
    1. Get your Google Maps API Key:
       - Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
       - Create a new project or select an existing one
       - Enable these APIs:
         * Maps JavaScript API
         * Places API
         * Geocoding API
       - Create an API key in Credentials section
       
    2. Replace the API key in index.html:
       - Open index.html
       - Find this line (around line 8):
         <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY&libraries=places"></script>
       - Replace YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY with your actual API key
       
    3. Optional - Restrict your API key:
       - In Google Cloud Console, go to Credentials
       - Click on your API key
       - Under "Application restrictions", select "HTTP referrers"
       - Add your website domain (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/*)
       - Under "API restrictions", select "Restrict key"
       - Choose only the APIs you enabled above
       
    4. Important Notes:
       - Keep your API key secure
       - Don't commit your actual API key to public repositories
       - Consider using environment-specific keys for production
       - Monitor your API usage in Google Cloud Console
       
    For testing locally without restrictions:
    - You can leave the key unrestricted initially
    - But remember to add restrictions before deploying to production
    
    If you don't want to use the GEO tagging feature:
    - You can remove the Google Maps script tag from index.html
    - The rest of the application will work without it
    - The map section will show an error but other features remain functional
